## Introduction
This is a framework towards action recognition task based on deep learning. It is mainly constructed by Pytorch. Currently, it assembles some famous models of action recognition. And this framework has some advantages as follows:
1) This is the whole pipeline for action recognition based on deep learning, it contains from data to training of the model, and evaluation of the model. As the following figure shows. 
<div  align='center'>
<img src="./img/1.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
</div>
2) You only need to modify the configuration file to complete the training and evaluation of the model.
3) For the whole training of the model, the framework can record training info and record training policy. And after evaluating the model, the framework can output evaluation info and statistic info specifically.
## Requirement
